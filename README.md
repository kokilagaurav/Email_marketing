## üîÑ Workflow & Methodology

### 1. Data Loading & Preprocessing
- Load three separate CSV files containing email interaction data
- Merge datasets on `email_id` to create comprehensive dataset
- Handle missing values by filling NaN with 0 for binary indicators
- Create engagement status categories:
  - **"Not Opened"**: User didn't open the email
  - **"Opened but Not Clicked"**: User opened but didn't click
  - **"Clicked and Opened"**: User both opened and clicked

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Univariate Analysis**: Distribution of individual features
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Relationships between features and target variable
- **Time-based Analysis**: Engagement patterns by hour and day of week
- **Geographic Analysis**: Performance across different countries
- **Content Analysis**: Impact of email text type and version

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identify relationships between numerical features
- **Chi-Square Tests**: Test independence between categorical variables
- **Contingency Tables**: Cross-tabulation of categorical features

### 4. Data Visualization
- Pair plots for numerical features
- Bar charts for categorical distributions
- Heatmaps for correlation matrices
- Time series plots for temporal patterns
- Box plots for distribution analysis

### 5. Feature Engineering
- Create numerical encoding for engagement status
- Identify and remove anomalies (clicked without opening)
- Select relevant features for modeling

### 6. Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - One-hot encoding for categorical variables
